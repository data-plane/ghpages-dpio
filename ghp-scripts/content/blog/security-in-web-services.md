This post describes how the world of Web Services and the world of information security are coming together. Web Services and security make a compelling match, because Web Services need security in order to widespread deployment, and security technologies need the ease of deployment provided by Web Services. In theory at least, this is a win-win situation. The downside, though, is that the technologies can be complex and difficult to understand.

This post will try to help you understand Web Service security by explaining these technologies.
