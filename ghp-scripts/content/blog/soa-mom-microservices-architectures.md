Message Oriented Middleware (MOM) is a concept that involves the asynchronously passing of messages between applications. According to Wikipedia, Service-oriented architecture (SOA) is a style of software design where services are provided to the other components by application components, through a communication protocol over a network.

Both approaches SOA and MOM, in our opinion, represent the fundamental pillars of new Microservices-based Architectures, even of the Cloud Native Applications. 

If you are interested in these matters, we are proud of sharing technical articles we wrote about ESB, API, Mediation, Microservices and Security.
