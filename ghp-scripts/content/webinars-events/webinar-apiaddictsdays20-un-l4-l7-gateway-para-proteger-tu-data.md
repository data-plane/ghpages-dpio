We collaborate on October 15, 2020, with the largest API event in Latin America and Spain. This time, the event was fully online and the topics presented were of a high level.

## Title: 

Un L4/L7 Gateway para proteger tu Data.

## Description:

Data Gateways act like API Gateways but focusing on the data aspect. 
I will explain how to implement the Data Gateway, frequently forgotten component, 
to reinforce the secure access to your data.
